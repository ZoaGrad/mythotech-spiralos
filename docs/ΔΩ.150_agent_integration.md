# ΔΩ.150 — Agent Integration Layer

ΔΩ.150 introduces a contract-stable Agent Integration Layer that allows
Discord, Comet, Codex, and other μApps to consume the ΔΩ.149 façade safely.
The layer is read-only and rides on top of the previously certified
`core.spiral_api` entrypoints.

## AgentContext

`core.agent_context.AgentContext` is an immutable dataclass that captures
per-call metadata (agent id, version, session id, request id, issuance time,
lineage, and arbitrary metadata). The `create()` constructor generates
stable identifiers, locks metadata via `MappingProxyType`, and emits a
`serialize()` payload for transport to μApps or observability sinks.

## AgentBridge

`core.agent_bridge.AgentBridge` stores the `AgentContext` and delegates
all contract calls to the façade: ScarIndex, PanicFrame, SystemPulse, and
GovernanceStatus. No business logic is duplicated; it is purely a context-
preserving wrapper that forwards requests.

## SDK Helpers

`sdk.agents` exposes helper functions (`fetch_scar_index`,
`fetch_system_status`, `submit_panic_frame`, and `evaluate_governance_event`)
that construct an `AgentContext`, invoke the `AgentBridge`, and return an
`AgentResult` with serialized context plus the façade contract payload.

## Validation

`tests/test_agent_integration.py` exercises:

- `AgentContext.serialize()` for deterministic payload structure.
- `AgentBridge` passthrough calls to ensure contract types are preserved.
- SDK helpers returning `AgentResult` objects with context and payloads.

All runtime logic remains untouched. Pytest and flake8 cover the new files
without altering existing ΔΩ.149 contracts.
