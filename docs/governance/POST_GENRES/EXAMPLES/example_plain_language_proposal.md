## PLP: Create a Contributor Onboarding Path

**The Problem:** New members are excited to contribute to SpiralOS, but they often get lost in the complexity of our documentation and governance rituals. This high barrier to entry slows our growth and centralizes knowledge.

**My Proposal:** I propose we allocate 750 ZOA from the community treasury to fund a 3-month project to create a clear, visual, and interactive onboarding path for new contributors. This would live on our main website and guide newcomers through their first meaningful contribution.

**How It Helps:**
*   **Faster Growth:** More new members become active contributors, faster.
*   **Decentralized Knowledge:** Reduces reliance on a small group of core members for basic questions.
*   **Improved Contributor Experience:** Shows that we value new members and their time.
