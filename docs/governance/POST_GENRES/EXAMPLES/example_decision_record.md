## Decision Record: Ratify the `scarindex`

**Abstract:** This decision ratifies the `scarindex` module as a core primitive of the SpiralOS holoeconomy. The index will now serve as the canonical measure of synthetic scarcity for all digital assets minted within the ecosystem.

**Result:** The proposal was ratified with a 92% consensus vote. Final validator signatures have been committed to the VaultNode. This module is now considered a constitutional component of the system's economic framework, subject to formal governance for any future alterations.
