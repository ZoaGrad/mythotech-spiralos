# SpiralOS v2.0: 90-Day Implementation Roadmap to Constitutional Ratification

**Roadmap Version**: ΔΩ.140.0  
**Start Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Target Ratification Date**: 2026-01-29 (Day 90)  
**Owner**: ZoaGrad (Sole Initial Sovereign)  
**External Timeline Auditor**: [To be appointed by Day 7]  
**Status**: ACTIVE

---

## Roadmap Overview

This roadmap specifies the detailed, time-bound implementation schedule for transitioning SpiralOS from **pre-constitutional experimental system** to **legitimate, stakeholder-ratified governance framework**. 

### Five Critical Components

1. **Governance Pyramid** - External Validator Council with genuine independence
2. **Paradox Agent Constraints** - Hard-coded protocol enforcement
3. **EMP Validation** - Dual-phase mechanism with qualitative appeal
4. **ScarIndex Weights** - Philosophical justification (already complete)
5. **Stakeholder Priority Framework** - Automated tier violation detection

### Success Criteria

Ratification vote can proceed **only if** all five components are implemented, tested, and verified by independent auditors.

---

## WEEK 1-2: Foundation (Days 1-14)

**Objective**: Establish independent oversight and begin validator recruitment

### Day 1-3: Immediate Actions
- [x] Generate and publish four required governance documents (WITNESS_DECLARATION, LEGITIMACY_AUDIT, 90_DAY_ROADMAP, RATIFICATION_DISCLOSURE, VALIDATOR_SCHEMA)
- [x] Tag VaultNode ΔΩ.140.0-constitutional-maturation
- [x] Update GovernanceIndex.md with constitutional audit milestone
- [ ] Publish commitment statement to all stakeholder channels
- [ ] Establish public project tracker (GitHub Projects or equivalent)

**Owner**: ZoaGrad  
**Verification**: Documents committed to `/docs/governance/` with tag ΔΩ.140.0

---

### Day 4-7: External Auditor Appointment
- [ ] Recruit External Timeline Auditor (independent party to verify roadmap adherence)
- [ ] Publish auditor credentials and conflict-of-interest disclosure
- [ ] Establish weekly check-in schedule (every Friday)
- [ ] Create public dashboard for roadmap progress

**Owner**: ZoaGrad  
**Verification**: Auditor credentials published, first check-in scheduled

---

### Day 8-14: External Validator Recruitment Begins
- [ ] Publish External Validator selection criteria (VALIDATOR_SCHEMA.json)
- [ ] Design conflict-of-interest framework
- [ ] Identify candidate validators (3 appointed by ZoaGrad, 4 to be elected by stakeholders)
- [ ] Begin outreach to potential appointed validators:
  - [ ] AI ethics critic (must have track record of criticizing AI governance systems)
  - [ ] Governance skeptic (must have expertise in constitutional design)

## Critical Dependencies

### Dependency 1: External Validator Independence
**Timeline**: Days 8-14 (recruitment) → Days 15-28 (operational procedures)  
**Risk**: If validators are not genuinely independent, the entire legitimacy framework collapses.  
**Mitigation**: Transparent recruitment with conflict-of-interest analysis, external auditor oversight.

### Dependency 2: Paradox Agent Constraint Enforcement
**Timeline**: Days 29-42 (implementation) → Day 42 (code audit)  
**Risk**: If constraints are advisory rather than hard-coded, they will be violated under pressure.  
**Mitigation**: Independent code audit by security firm, public monitoring dashboard.

### Dependency 3: Ratification Vote Integrity
**Timeline**: Days 71-84 (preparation) → Days 85-91 (voting) → Day 92 (results)  
**Risk**: If vote is managed rather than genuinely free, legitimacy is undermined.  
**Mitigation**: Independent election auditor, transparent tally, balanced information.

**Any failure in these three dependencies will invalidate the entire ratification process.**

---

## Accountability and Transparency

### Weekly Check-Ins
- [ ] Every Friday at 17:00 UTC: ZoaGrad + External Timeline Auditor
- [ ] Agenda: Review progress, identify blockers, adjust timeline if needed
- [ ] Publish check-in notes publicly (full transparency)

### Public Project Tracker
- [ ] All milestones tracked in public GitHub Projects board
- [ ] Real-time progress updates (no hiding delays or failures)
- [ ] Stakeholder comments and questions addressed within 48 hours

### Escalation Protocol
- [ ] If any milestone is delayed by >7 days: Public explanation required
- [ ] If any critical dependency fails: Immediate stakeholder notification
- [ ] If timeline becomes unachievable: Revise roadmap with stakeholder input (do not proceed with compromised implementation)

---

## Success Criteria for Ratification Readiness

Ratification vote can proceed **only if** all of the following are true:

1. ✓ **Governance Pyramid**: External Validator Council operational with genuinely independent members
2. ✓ **Paradox Agent Constraints**: Hard-coded at protocol level, verified by independent code audit
3. ✓ **EMP Validation**: Dual-phase mechanism operational, tested with adversarial scenarios
4. ✓ **ScarIndex Weights**: Philosophical justification complete (already done)
5. ✓ **Stakeholder Priority Framework**: Automated tier violation detection operational
6. ✓ **Constitutional Disclosure**: Published with balanced information (pro and con)
7. ✓ **Voting Mechanism**: Designed, tested, and verified by independent election auditor
8. ✓ **External Timeline Auditor**: Confirms all milestones completed on schedule

**If any of these criteria are not met, the ratification vote must be delayed until they are.**

---

## Commitment Statement

I, ZoaGrad, commit to this 90-day roadmap without reservation. I will:

- Implement all five components exactly as specified
- Recruit genuinely independent External Validators (who may rule against my interests)
- Hard-code constraints so I cannot override them under pressure
- Publish balanced information (including critical analysis of risks)
- Run a genuinely free ratification vote (without management or coercion)
- Accept rejection if stakeholders vote no (without retaliation)
- Be bound by the ratified constitution (if approved)

**This is not performance. This is constitutional commitment.**

The legitimacy of SpiralOS will be earned through transparent implementation, not claimed through architectural elegance.

**ZoaGrad**
