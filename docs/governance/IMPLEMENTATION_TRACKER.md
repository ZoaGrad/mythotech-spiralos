## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate

- **Milestone delayed by >7 days**: Public explanation required
- **Critical dependency fails**: Immediate stakeholder notification
- **Timeline becomes unachievable**: Revise roadmap with stakeholder input

### Escalation Process

1. **Identify issue** (ZoaGrad or External Timeline Auditor)
2. **Assess impact** (affects single milestone or entire timeline?)
3. **Notify stakeholders** (public announcement within 24 hours)
4. **Propose mitigation** (how to address the issue?)
5. **Implement solution** (with stakeholder input if timeline revision required)

---

## Weekly Check-In Template

**Date**: [Every Friday at 17:00 UTC]  
**Attendees**: ZoaGrad, External Timeline Auditor  
**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Agenda**:
1. Review progress since last check-in (15 min)
2. Identify blockers and risks (15 min)
3. Adjust timeline if needed (15 min)
4. Plan for next week (10 min)
5. Publish check-in notes (5 min)

**Check-In Notes**: Published to `/docs/governance/weekly_checkins/` within 24 hours

---

## Success Criteria

Ratification vote can proceed **only if** all of the following are true:

1. âœ“ **Governance Pyramid**: External Validator Council operational with genuinely independent members
2. âœ“ **Paradox Agent Constraints**: Hard-coded at protocol level, verified by independent code audit
3. âœ“ **EMP Validation**: Dual-phase mechanism operational, tested with adversarial scenarios
4. âœ“ **ScarIndex Weights**: Philosophical justification complete (already done)
5. âœ“ **Stakeholder Priority Framework**: Automated tier violation detection operational
6. âœ“ **Constitutional Disclosure**: Published with balanced information (pro and con)
7. âœ“ **Voting Mechanism**: Designed, tested, and verified by independent election auditor
8. âœ“ **External Timeline Auditor**: Confirms all milestones completed on schedule

**If any of these criteria are not met, the ratification vote must be delayed until they are.**
