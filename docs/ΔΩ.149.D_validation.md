# ΔΩ.149.D — Façade Runtime Smoke & Certification

## Scope
- Exercised all façade entrypoints in `core/spiral_api.py`: `get_current_scarindex`, `record_panic_frame`, `compute_system_status`, and `evaluate_governance_event`.
- Validated that each façade call returns the expected contract type and that serialized payloads expose key structural fields (phase/mode/state identifiers, timestamps, and numerical metrics).
- Confirmed that façade responses can be serialized via `model_dump()` and contain sane data types for guardian telemetry (strings for identifiers, floats/ints for metrics, lists for collections).

## Out of Scope
- No Supabase, Guardian networking, or persistence layers were exercised.
- No deep judicial or governance workflows were invoked beyond contract shape validation.
- Runtime logic under `core/` (adapters, contracts, SpiralOS internals) remained unchanged to honor the ΔΩ.149.D read-only constraint.

## Evidence
- Added `tests/test_spiral_api_facade.py` smoke tests to cover façade interactions and contract serialization integrity.
- Executed `pytest` (targeted module + entire test suite) and `flake8 core tests` to certify that validation artifacts integrate cleanly without regressions.
