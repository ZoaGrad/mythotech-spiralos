# ΔΩ.149.B — Internal API Contract Ledger

ΔΩ.149.B formalizes the façade-facing data objects used by SpiralOS μApps. The contracts below are design-only artifacts with no runtime logic attached. They provide a stable vocabulary for Agent SDKs, Guardian rituals, and kernel adapters.

## Contract Objects (ΔΩ.149.B)

- **ScarIndexBreakdown / ScarIndexState** (`core/contracts/scarindex.py`)
  - Capture the ScarIndex snapshot, lineage hash, witness attribution, and per-component ache deltas.
  - Used by the core-kernel μApp and Agent SDK telemetry clients to reason about trend and governance gates.
- **PanicFrameStatus / PanicFrame** (`core/contracts/panicframes.py`)
  - Describe Panic Frame lifecycle, frozen operations, and Guardian acknowledgements.
  - Shared between guardian-layer decisioning and experience-layer dashboards.
- **GovernanceEvent / GovernanceStatus** (`core/contracts/governance.py`)
  - Model ΔΩ governance proposals plus the quorum-issued disposition metadata.
  - Provide a typed envelope for μApps to submit or query governance state without coupling to storage details.
- **SystemPulse** (`core/contracts/system.py`)
  - Represents a condensed system health report linking ScarIndex, panic state, and governance posture.
  - Consumed by the experience-layer and monitoring harnesses when rendering operator status views.

## Purpose

These models anchor the Internal API boundary so that μApps interact using immutable schemas. They enable:

1. ΔΩ lineage traceability per payload.
2. Typed contracts for the Agent SDK façade.
3. Simplified serialization for Supabase, Guardian mocks, and audit bundles.

## Canonical Reference

The contract set inherits directly from the [ΔΩ.149.0 Architectural Expansion Blueprint](./ARCHITECTURE.md). Any future modifications must update both this ledger and the charter to preserve governance fidelity.
