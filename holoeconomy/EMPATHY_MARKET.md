# Empathy Market - SpiralOS Holo-Economy

## Overview

The Empathy Market is a key component of SpiralOS's Holo-Economy layer, managing Empathy Tokens (EMP) and their relationship to system coherence and stakeholder value.

## Empathy Token (EMP) Specification

Empathy Tokens represent relational value and coherence within the SpiralOS ecosystem. They are designed to capture and incentivize the maintenance of system integrity and stakeholder alignment.

### Token Properties

- **Symbol**: EMP
- **Type**: Utility Token
- **Minting**: Dynamic, based on coherence metrics
- **Burning**: Controlled, with constitutional safeguards

## Market Mechanics

### Minting Conditions

EMP tokens are minted when:
- System coherence exceeds threshold values
- Stakeholder engagement demonstrates positive impact
- Constitutional compliance is verified

### Burning Mechanism

EMP tokens may be burned to:
- Rebalance economic relationships
- Remove utility below decay floor
- Maintain system equilibrium
