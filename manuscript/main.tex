\textbf{Context:} The quantization of cognitive labor has historically been constrained by subjective assessment and institutional validation. As knowledge work becomes increasingly autonomous, the lack of an objective, thermodynamic metric for "thinking" creates a value gap. 
\textbf{Methodology:} We introduce "Algorithmic Sovereignty," a framework for measuring intellectual work as thermodynamic exergy. We constructed a closed-loop digital organism ("ZoaGrad") comprising a nervous system (Git/Webhooks), a logic engine (Python), and an immutable ledger (Supabase). This system monitors input vectors—code commits and manual cognitive logs—and transmutes them into Work Interaction (WI) energy using a complexity-weighted formula.
\textbf{Results:} We report the first experimental validation of this system: the capture of a "Genesis Spike" of \textbf{96.4286 J} generated via a manual cognitive injection command (`!log`). 
\textbf{Conclusion:} This experiment proves that cognitive labor can be self-authenticated and immutably ledgered without a trusted third party, laying the foundation for a sovereign economy based on Proof-of-Thermodynamic-Work.

\section{Introduction}
The quantization of cognitive labor has historically been plagued by subjectivity...

\section{Methodology: The Thermodynamic Engine}
We define Work Interaction (WI) energy as:
\[ WI = (Volume \times Complexity^{1.5}) \times \frac{1}{1 + 4E} \]

\section{Results: The Genesis Spike}
Figure 1 demonstrates the capture of 96.4286 J...

\section{Conclusion}
Algorithmic Sovereignty is achieved when the worker owns the ledger of their own entropy reduction.
