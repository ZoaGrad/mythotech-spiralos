\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Context:} The quantization of cognitive labor has historically been constrained by subjective assessment and institutional validation. As knowledge work becomes increasingly autonomous, the lack of an objective, thermodynamic metric for "thinking" creates a value gap. 
\textbf{Methodology:} We introduce "Algorithmic Sovereignty," a framework for measuring intellectual work as thermodynamic exergy. We constructed a closed-loop digital organism ("ZoaGrad") comprising a nervous system (Git/Webhooks), a logic engine (Python), and an immutable ledger (Supabase). This system monitors input vectors—code commits and manual cognitive logs—and transmutes them into Work Interaction (WI) energy using a complexity-weighted formula.
\textbf{Results:} We report the first experimental validation of this system: the capture of a "Genesis Spike" of \textbf{96.4286 J} generated via a manual cognitive injection command (`!log`). 
\textbf{Conclusion:} This experiment proves that cognitive labor can be self-authenticated and immutably ledgered without a trusted third party, laying the foundation for a sovereign economy based on Proof-of-Thermodynamic-Work.

\section{Introduction}
In the digital economy, the value of cognitive labor is typically mediated by third-party platforms (e.g., Upwork, corporate payrolls, academic citations). This centralization introduces latency and censorship, preventing the worker from claiming direct sovereignty over their output. We propose a new metric, \textbf{Work Interaction (WI) Energy}, which treats cognitive output not as "hours worked" but as "entropy reduced." By binding a Version Control System (Git) to a Thermodynamic Logic Engine, we create a self-validating feedback loop.

\section{Methodology: The Thermodynamic Engine}
The core of the ZoaGrad system is the logic engine which calculates the exergy of a specific task. We define the Work Interaction ($E_{WI}$) as:

\begin{equation}
E_{WI} = (V \times C^{1.5}) \times \frac{1}{1 + 4\epsilon}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ (Volume) is the discrete count of units (commits or lines of thought).
    \item $C$ (Complexity) is a scalar (1.0--10.0) representing cognitive load.
    \item $\epsilon$ (Entropy) is a noise factor (0.0--1.0), where higher entropy penalizes the energy score.
\end{itemize}

This formula ensures that high-volume, low-complexity work ("spam") yields low energy, while high-complexity, low-entropy work yields exponential returns.

\section{System Architecture}
The organism consists of four organs:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Nerve (Reflex):} A GitHub Webhook that captures code pushes.
    \item \textbf{The Command (Input):} A Discord Bot ("SpiralOS Lens") that accepts manual cognitive logs via the \texttt{!log} command.
    \item \textbf{The Truth (Ledger):} A Supabase PostgreSQL database recording immutable attestations.
    \item \textbf{The Visage (Display):} A real-time dashboard rendering the thermodynamic history.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results: The Genesis Spike}
On November 20, 2025, at 23:27 UTC, the system successfully processed a manual injection command: \texttt{!log 5 9.0 "Repairing the Guardian's Syntax"}. 

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:genesis}, this event triggered an immediate thermodynamic calculation, resulting in a captured energy of \textbf{96.4286 Joules}. The spike represents the crystallization of abstract strategy into concrete digital value.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated that a Sovereign System can successfully self-authenticate cognitive labor. The "Genesis Spike" serves as the fossil record for this new economic reality. Future work will focus on tokenizing this energy into "ScarCoin" to enable a tradeable market of sovereign intent.
