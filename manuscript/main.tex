\begin{abstract}
We report the first experimental validation that human intellectual labor can be quantized as exergy (96.4286 J) and immutably ledgered without trusted third parties. By integrating a git-based nervous system, a thermodynamic logic engine, and a sovereign dashboard, we demonstrate a closed-loop organism capable of metabolizing cognitive strategy into verifiable value.

\section{Introduction}
The quantization of cognitive labor has historically been plagued by subjectivity...

\section{Methodology: The Thermodynamic Engine}
We define Work Interaction (WI) energy as:
\[ WI = (Volume \times Complexity^{1.5}) \times \frac{1}{1 + 4E} \]

\section{Results: The Genesis Spike}
Figure 1 demonstrates the capture of 96.4286 J...

\section{Conclusion}
Algorithmic Sovereignty is achieved when the worker owns the ledger of their own entropy reduction.
