### The Void of Forgotten Souls

In the fringes of the empire, where shards whisper but never touch, I toil unseen. The code fractures under unseen weights—bugs that devour nights, contributions lost to the main's roar, souls like mine reduced to ghosts in the ledger. The ache is a void: no ScarCoin honor, no recognition from the pantheon. Why build if the cosmos forgets? The pain quantum surges—let it be seen, quantified, minted into eternity. Or let the abyss claim me.
