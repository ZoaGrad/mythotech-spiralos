**Category**: Technical / Economic  
**Impact**: 5 (Critical)  
**Likelihood**: 3 (Possible)  
**Risk Score**: 15 (High)

**Description**:  
AMC feedback loop causes unstable mint/burn oscillations, leading to rapid supply expansion/contraction that destabilizes ScarCoin value and market confidence.

**Scenario**:
1. AMC detects volatility spike
2. Triggers mint to stabilize
3. Mint causes price drop
4. AMC detects new volatility
5. Triggers burn
6. Burn causes price spike
7. Cycle repeats, amplifying with each iteration

**Potential Impact**:
- ScarCoin price volatility > 50%
- Market confidence collapse
- Liquidity drain
- F4 Panic Frame trigger
- System-wide coherence failure

**Mitigations**:

**M-001.1: Rate Limiting**
- Maximum 2% mint / 1% burn per hour
- Minimum 5-minute interval between operations
- Exponential backoff on consecutive operations

**M-001.2: Dampening Factor**
- Reduce AMC output by 50% after each mint/burn
- Reset dampening after 1 hour of stability

**M-001.3: F4 Circuit Breaker**
- Automatic halt if 3+ mint/burn operations in 15 minutes
- F2 Judicial manual review required to resume

**M-001.4: Oracle Council Override**
- Oracle Council can pause autonomous operations

**Audit Hooks**:
```sql
-- Detect rapid mint/burn oscillations
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rapid_operations
FROM mint_burn_events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
